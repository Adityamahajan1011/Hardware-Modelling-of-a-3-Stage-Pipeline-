# Hardware-Modelling-of-a-3-Stage-Pipeline-
The project demonstrates pipelining concepts, stage-wise registers, control and data flow, and shows how throughput is improved over non-pipelined designs. Pipelining concept is used to improve computation time for a processor when there are a large number of input entities .
